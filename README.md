### break fork and work on the version in BIOS-SCOPE GitHub space 12 June 2026 

### Some details:
This was done in MATLAB in order to best use Ruth Curry's code organizing the BATS CTD data and for making calculations of BV frequency (using the SEAWATER library from CSIRO). 

I saved a CSV with the results, but that file is too large for GitHub so it is sitting in the BIOS-SCOPE Google Drive. If you are reading this here, chances are pretty good you know how to find the file.

After talking with Ruth, plot this in log10 space and filter the BV data (using get_bvfilt.m)

The primary m-file is written in MATLAB: ([getBATSdata_LTT_KLv2.m](https://github.com/redbluewater/BATSallTime_LTT/blob/main/getBATSdata_LTT_KLv2.m)), and you can follow the link if you want to see what I did. That m-file calls a few other m-files, all of which are here in GitHub.

This figure shows the comparison between Craig's calculations and Krista's: <img src ="https://github.com/redbluewater/BATSallTime_LTT/blob/main/BATS_bvfrq_cfKLandCC.jpg" width ="75%" height="75%">

Here is a JPG with the results - two subplots (top is using the 2db CTD data and bottom is the plot from the data in the Excel file):
